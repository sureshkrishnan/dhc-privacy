 <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
  <t>DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"/> is a protocol that is used to
  provide addressing and configuration information to IPv6 hosts. The
  DHCPv6 protocol uses several identifiers that could become a source
  for gleaming additional information about the IPv6 host. This
  information may include device type, operating system information,
  location(s) that the device may have previously visited etc.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Terminology">
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
   target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
 </section>

<section title="Identifiers in DHCPv6">
  <t>There are several identifiers used in DHCPv6. This section
  provides a short introduction to the various options that will be
  used further in the document.</t>

  <section title="DUID">
    <t>Each DHCPv6 client and server have a DHCP Unique
    Identifier(DUID)<xref target="RFC3315"/>. The DUID is designed to
    be unique across all DHCP clients and servers, and to remain
    stable after it has been initially generated. The DUID can be of
    different forms. Commonly used forms are based on the link-layer
    address of one of the device's network interfaces (with or without
    a timestamp), on the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) <xref
    target="RFC6355"/>, etc. </t></section>

  <section title="Client ID Option">
    <t>The Client Identifier Option (OPTION_CLIENTID) is used to carry
    the DUID of a DHCPv6 client between a client and a server. There
    is an analogous Server Identifier Option but it is not of much
    interest in the privacy context. </t></section>

  <section title="IA_NA, IA_TA and the IA Address Options">
    <t>The Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (IA_NA)
    option <xref target="RFC3315"/> is used to carry the parameters
    and any non-temporary addresses associated with the given
    IA_NA. The IA_TA option is analogous to the IA_NA option but for
    temporary addresses. The IA Address option is used to specify IPv6
    addresses associated with an IA_NA or an IA_TA and is encapsulated
    within the Options field of such an IA_NA or IA_TA
    option.</t></section>

  <section title="Interface ID">
    <t>A DHCPv6 relay includes the Interface ID <xref
    target="RFC3315"/> option to identify the interface on which it
    received the client message thatis being relayed.</t></section>

  <section title="Subscriber ID">
    <t>A DHCPv6 relay includes a Subscriber ID option <xref
    target="RFC4580"/> to associate some provider-specific information
    with clients' DHCPv6 messages that is independent of the physical
    network configuration.</t></section>

  <section title="Remote ID">
    <t>A DHCPv6 relay includes a Remote ID option <xref
    target="RFC4649"/> to identify the remote host end of the
    circuit.</t></section>

  <section title="FQDN Option">
    <t>The Client FQDN option <xref target="RFC4704"/> is used by
    DHCPv6 clients and servers to exchange information about the
    client's fully qualified domain name</t></section>

  <section title="Client Link-layer Address Option">
    <t>The Client link-layer address option <xref target="RFC6939"/>
    is used by first-hop DHCPv6 relays to provide the client's
    link-layer address towards the server.</t></section>

  <section title="Option Request Option">
    <t>DHCPv6 clients include an Option Request option in DHCPv6
    messages to inform the server about options the client wants the
    server to send to the client.</t></section>

  <section title="Vendor Class Option">
    <t>This option is used by a DHCPv6 client to identify the vendor
    that manufactured the hardware on which the client is
    running.</t></section>

  <section title="Civic Location Option">
    <t>DHCPv6 servers use the Civic Location Option <xref target="RFC4776"/> to convey the civic and postal addresses to DHCPv6 clients.</t></section>

</section>

 <section title="Attacks">

 <section title="Finding device type">
  <t>The type of device used by the client can be guessed by the attacker using the Vendor Class Option, the Client Link-layer Address Option, and by parsing the Client ID Option.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Finding operating system">
  <t>The operating system running on a client can be guessed using the Vendor Class Option, or by using fingerprinting techniques on the combination of options requested using the Option Request Option.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Finding civic address information">
  <t>The civic address can be obtained by the attacker by many means. The most direct way to obtain this information is by looking into a server initiated message that contains the Civic Location Option. It can also be indirectly infered using the Remote ID Option (e.g. using a telephone number), the Interface ID option (e.g. if an access circuit on an Access Node corresponds to a civic location), or the Subscriber ID Option (if the attacker has access to subscriber info).
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Finding previously visited networks">
  <t>When DHCPv6 clients to a network they attempt to request the same address they had before they attached to a network. They do this by putting the previously assigned address in the IA Address Options inside the IA_NA, IA_TA. By observing these addresses, an attacker can identify the network the client had previously visited.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Finding a stable identity">
  <t>An attacker might use a stable identity gleamed from DHCPv6 messages to correlate activities of a given client on unrelated networks. The Client FQDN option, the Subscriber ID Option and the Client ID options can serve as long lived identifiers of DHCPv6 clients. The Client FQDN option can also provide an identity that can easily be correlated with web server activity logs.
